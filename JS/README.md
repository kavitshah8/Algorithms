#### Frequently asked interview questions

1. prototypal inheritance
2. closures - Modularize code, Private Methods 
3. event queue and event loop - Avoid recursion sometimes
4. `type of` , `hasOwnProperty` something - check for type before any operations, to avoid prototypical chain lookup 
5. scope `this` - JS has `function scope` in contrast to `C` which has a `block scope`.
6. Dynamic scoping with `apply`
