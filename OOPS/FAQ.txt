0. Base class vs Derived class

1. Interface vs Abstract class

2. Overriding vs Overloading 
		
		Overiding - 
			It occurs when a method shares the same name and function signature as another method in its super class. 
			For example,
			Shape = function(){ ... }
			Shape.prototype.printMe("I am Shape");

			Circle = new Shape();
			Circle.prototype.printMe("I am Circle");

		Overloading -

			- Operator overloading 
					using + sign for addition as well as string concatenation
		
			- Method/Functional over loading:
					means when two methods have the same name but differ in the type of or number of arguments, meaning it differs in function signature. For example, 
					`int computeArea (int a ) { ... }`
					`int computeArea (float a ) { ... }`
					`int computeArea (int a, int b ) { ... }`
